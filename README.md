Hi this is my clothes store called CoolGoods! (Where the cool people shop)

It utilizes Bootstrap and Jinja for frontend and Python and Mongo for backend

It has three resources:
1. Products
2. Cart
3. Reviews

Products and Cart have CRUD implemented, as for reviews we can only add them (Permanent Reviews)

The store keeps track of inventory, and if the product is out of stock, it will tell you and not let you add it to the store.

It has 9 total products, soooo... Happy Shopping!
